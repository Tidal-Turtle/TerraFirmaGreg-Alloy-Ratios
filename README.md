# TerraFirmaGreg-Alloy-Ratios
TFG-AR is a Python script that takes some basic information about the alloy you want to make in TerraFirmaGreg, a Minecraft Mod, and spits out the most efficient combination of ores for that alloy. Efficient means that you lose as little as possible from leftover alloy.
